# 🧮 AverageGrades – Day 5

This Java program takes **5 grades** as input from the user, stores them in an **array**, and calculates the **average** using a **for loop**.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts
- **Array:** Used to store multiple values of the same data type (`double` in this case)  
- **For Loop:** Repeats a set of instructions (input and summation of grades)  
- **User Input:** Uses `Scanner` to read values entered by the user  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter 5 grades.  
2. Each grade is stored in an array.  
3. All grades are summed up and divided by 5 to get the average.  
4. The average is displayed on the screen.
