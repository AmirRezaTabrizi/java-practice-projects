# Day 15 – Polymorphism & Method Override

Practice using polymorphism with multiple subclasses.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Polymorphism through parent reference
- Overriding `move()` method in subclasses
- Different behaviors for different animal types

Classes:
- `Animal`
- `Bird` (flies)
- `Fish` (swims)
