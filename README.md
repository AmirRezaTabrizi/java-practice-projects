# 🧠 Java Practice Projects

Welcome to my **Java Practice Projects** repository!  
This repo includes all of my **daily coding exercises and mini-projects** that I’ve built while learning Java (from August to November 2025).

Each folder here represents one small hands-on project focused on a specific Java concept — from basic syntax and control flow to OOP, collections, and file handling.  
These exercises help me move from *just learning theory* to *writing real, working code* every day.

## 📅 Learning Timeline

| Phase | Date Range | Focus | Example Projects |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 🧩 Basics | 1-3 November | Variables, input/output, conditionals, loops | Hello User, Calculator, Grade Checker |
| 🔁 Arrays & Methods | 4–8 November | Arrays, methods, strings | Average Calculator, String Analyzer |
| 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming | 9–14 November | Classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation | Person, Library Manager |
| 📦 Collections & File I/O | 15–19 November | Lists, maps, exceptions, file handling | Student Records, File Reader |
| 🚀 Final Project | 20-30 November | Review and Integration | Student Manager (full mini-project) |
